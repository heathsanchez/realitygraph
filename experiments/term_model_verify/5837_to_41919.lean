class Magma (α : Type _) where
  /-- The binary magma operation, written `◇`. -/
  op : α → α → α

@[inherit_doc] infix:65 " ◇ " => Magma.op

/-- Build a `Magma (Fin n)` from a flat list of values.
    Entry at index `i*n + j` gives the result of `i ◇ j`.
    Usage: `instance : Magma (Fin 3) := magmaFin 3 [0,0,0, 0,0,0, 0,0,1]`

    Marked `@[implicit_reducible]` because Lean 4.32 requires class-valued
    definitions to be transparent to instance resolution. Deliberately not
    plain `@[reducible]`: that would unfold the table literal during general
    unification too, which is pure cost for the large `Fin n` tables here. -/
